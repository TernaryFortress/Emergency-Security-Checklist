# Emergency-Security-Checklist
This guide is intended for people attempting to escape "Hacker Hell", a situation in which all of their tech is 100% compromised.

One should follow up with the Emergency-Privacy-Checklist, to further enable secure and private connections to the outside world.

## IF YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES: CONTACT A PROFESSIONAL INSTEAD

## IF YOU HAVE TRANSPORTATION: SEEK AUTHORITIES INSTEAD

## IF YOU CAN, ENGAGE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO HELP

## Always remember to do your due-diligence to the fullest extent possible, especially if you are unable to verify the integrity of your internet connection.

I am not a security specialist, just someone who cares, who has noticed a need for something that doesn't yet exist, someone who knows for a fact that people are about to fall through the cracks.

## We strongly encourage more educated experts to iterate upon and improve this template.

This guide is for INDIVIDUAL USERS who are unable to, for one reason or another, seek outside help.
