# Security-Checklist

This repository is designed to serve as a rolling-update security checklist for closing the holes that big-tech's data-whoring practices open up.

We wish to do our best to ensure that only necessary adjustments are made, and to maximize usability of the end-user's devices.

# State-of-Play

Insofar as my own perspective is concerned, the internet as we knew it is dead. Chatbots produce much of the content that you see, and they are being controlled by people who prioritize profit and control over our collective well-being. Let's all do our best to engage with each other in the real world, to forge real friendships and social bonds, create lasting and impactful communities, and get back to doing what we do best: Being human beings together.
